# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Regressor-Model-for-Predicting-the-Salary-of-the-Employee

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Regressor Model for Predicting the Salary of the Employee.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Separate independent variable (X) and dependent variable (y).
2. Create a Decision Tree Regressor model.
3. Fit (train) the model using the dataset.
4. Predict the salary for a given input.
